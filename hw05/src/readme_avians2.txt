/**********************************************************************
 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  in your help log?  If not, do so now.  (And in future, make sure
 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

The extra credit with the bounce with difficult, especially figuring out the vectors.



/**********************************************************************
 *  If you completed the extra credit or added any additional features,
 *  provide DETAILED and CLEAR instructions for how to use them and 
 *  what we should look for when grading your assignment.

detailed drawing: drew the targets to look like a red and white bullseye.

changing target appearance with health: as the target HP decreases, the radius of the target increases by .05

velocity based HP deduction: multiply each HP by 10 and then decrease it by the magnitude of that target's velocity

bouncing ball: when bird hits a target, there should be a collision so they bounce off of each other.
the bird's velocity is refelcted about the vector between the target's center and the bird's center and
the target's velocity direction changes to match that of the bird's bounce velocity, but in the opposite direction.

was told not to fix style errors in code I didn't write and just wanted to clarify I didn't touch any code in IrateAvians2.java

the equations I used for vector reflection I got from a past gradescope rubric. I also got help udring office hours so I didn't look anything up
