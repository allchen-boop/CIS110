/**********************************************************************
 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  in your help log?  If not, do so now.  (And in future, make sure
 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

"I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any resources beyond the standard course materials."



/**********************************************************************
 *  Problem A:  What is the output of the following code?
 * 
 *     for (int i = 1; i < 8; i = i * 2) { 
 *         for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
 *             System.out.print(i * j); 
 *         } 
 *         System.out.println(); 
 *     }
 * 
 *  You should work your answer out by hand first.  Once you've
 *  traced through the code manually, you can confirm it using DrJava.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Problem B:  Translate the following while loop into an equivalent 
 *  for loop, without changing the initial value of n, so that the same
 *  values print.  Once you have done the conversion by hand, verify 
 *  your answer using DrJava.
 * 
 *     int n = 1024; 
 *     while (n > 0) { 
 *         n /= 2;
 *         System.out.println(n); 
 *     }

 **********************************************************************/
For some reason I kept getting the error that they could not find or load main class. I ended up having to delete my project and copy all of my code onto a new project.
